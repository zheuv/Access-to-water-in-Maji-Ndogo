I continue the work from where i left. the first page -National- is a detailed version of the first page of the previous report... the same is true of the second page - Queues-. As for the third and fourth pages - Pollution and Crime -, they are completely new and that comes from the new data I received. in both those pages,  I showed the pollution distribution at different provinces, the gender disparity related to water collectors which explains some of the gender disparity related to being a crime victim when collecting water.
