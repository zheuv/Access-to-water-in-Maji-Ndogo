The work done here is very simple, it relates to the relationship between access to water and queues in Maji Ndogo.
the first page contains simple visualisations which conveys an idea about the number of people served by location type (Rural - Urban).
the second page is our main one...it articulates the relationship between queues, days of the week, gender, and access to water.
the next directories would be a bit much more complex.
