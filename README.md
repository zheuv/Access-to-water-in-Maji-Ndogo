Within this repository, I will share my work in regards to highlighting the water crisis in Maji Ndogo using the structural and powerful  tools of data nalytics and PowerBI.
To this end, I developed a series of interactive, visually engaging reports using Power BI. These reports will aim to present our data in a
manner that is not only accessible but also compelling, ensuring that the key messages resonates. My focus will be on clarity
and impact, ensuring that the information provided drives informed decision-making and strategy formulation.
In my visual narrative, I will utilize clean and intuitive designs, with a colour scheme that subtly underscores the water crisis theme. My goal is to
make complex data comprehensible, engaging, and actionable. I believe that by presenting our data in this manner, I will not only inform but also
help make easier an understanding from which addressing the challenges faced in Maji Ndogo might be derived.
