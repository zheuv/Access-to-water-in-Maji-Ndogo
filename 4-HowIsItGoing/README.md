In this last document, I highlight the development that resulted from the third Document's analysis. 
I define the development by various crieterions, namely, the number of projects finished, the number of people helped, the number of projects finished, the cumulative cost and cumulative budget...
The overall development being made is shown in the first page, while the second displays the budget problems and challenges being met during the developing process.
Finally, the third page is an attempt to relate the budget problems to the cost and services of the vendors being hired to do the job.
