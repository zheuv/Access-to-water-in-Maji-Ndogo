I continue my work highlighting the water crisis in Maji Ndogo by adding a new layer to the equation, notably, the cost of the required improvements.
By conceptualising a defintion of what a basic access to water is, a detection  of any situation that falls away from that category is made possible... but also, this magic definition allowed us to conceive the required improvements that shall take place in a specific water source for it to fit in the category circled by our "basic access to water" definition. 
The first page highlights the relationship between the water crisis, the required improvements and their cost, on a national level, while the remaining pages showcase that same relationship on a provincial level.
