I continue my work highlighting the water crisi in Maji Ndogo by adding a new layer to the equation, notably, the cost of the required improvement.
by conceptualising a defintion of what a basic access to water is, a detetion  of any situation that falls under that line is made possible... but also, the definitoon of what a basic acces is is allowed us to define what are the required improvements that shall take ^place in a specific source of of water so that the latter can be considered as a source that fits in the category circled by our basic access to water definiton. the first page highlights the relationship between the water crisis , the required improvements and the cost on a national level, while the remainingpages hshowcases that same relationship on a provincial level.
